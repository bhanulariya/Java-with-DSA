1.What is a Computer?

Ans- A computer is an electronic data-processing system that accepts input, processes it using predefined instructions, stores data, and delivers output. It executes complex computational tasks with high speed, accuracy, and reliability — enabling automation, analytics, and decision support across industries.

2.What is RAM?

Ans- RAM (Random Access Memory) is a volatile primary memory that temporarily stores data and instructions actively used by the CPU. It accelerates processing performance by allowing instant read/write access, but all data is lost when the system is powered off.

3. Where is data stored in a computer?

Ans- Data in a computer is stored in storage devices such as:

- Primary Storage: RAM, Cache (for temporary data)

- Secondary Storage: Hard Disk Drives (HDD), Solid-State Drives (SSD)

External Storage: USB drives, Cloud storage, and Network drives
These storage mediums ensure persistent and retrievable data management.

4.What is the input device used to type text and numbers on a document in the computer system?

Ans- The Keyboard is the input device utilized for textual and numerical data entry. It operates via key-based signals that translate into digital codes processed by the computer system.

5.What are the output devices?

Ans- Output devices are peripherals that present processed data in human-readable form. Common examples include:

-Monitor 
-Printer 
-Speaker 
-Projector

6.Which is the input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?

Ans- The Mouse is the input device that enables cursor navigation and on-screen interaction through pointer movement and clicking actions.

7.Which language is directly understood by the computer without a translation program?

Ans- The Machine Language (Binary Language) is directly understood by the computer. It consists of 0s and 1s, representing on/off electrical states. It requires no translator and executes instructions at the hardware level.

8.What are Input Devices?

Ans- Input devices are hardware interfaces that feed raw data and commands into the computer for processing. Examples include:

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Scanner
- Microphone
- Webcam
